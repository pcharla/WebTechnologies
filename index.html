	<h2>this is where you wil find my profile</h2>
	<p>You were forever finding some new play.
		So when I saw you down on hands and knees
		In the meadow, busy with the new-cut hay,
		Trying, I thought, to set it up on end,
		I went to show you how to make it stay,
		If that was your idea, against the breeze,
		And, if you asked me, even help pretend
		To make it root again and grow afresh.
		But ’twas no make-believe with you to-day,
		Nor was the grass itself your real concern,
		Though I found your hand full of wilted fern,
		Steel-bright June-grass, and blackening heads of clover.
		’Twas a nest full of young birds on the ground
		The cutter-bar had just gone champing over
		(Miraculously without tasting flesh)
		And left defenseless to the heat and light.
		You wanted to restore them to their right
		Of something interposed between their sight
		And too much world at once—could means be found.
		The way the nest-full every time we stirred
		Stood up to us as to a mother-bird
		Whose coming home has been too long deferred,
		Made me ask would the mother-bird return
		And care for them in such a change of scene
		And might our meddling make her more afraid.
		That was a thing we could not wait to learn.
		We saw the risk we took in doing good,
		But dared not spare to do the best we could
		Though harm should come of it; so built the screen
		You had begun, and gave them back their shade.
		All this to prove we cared. Why is there then
		No more to tell? We turned to other things.
		I haven’t any memory—have you?—
		Of ever coming to the place again
		To see if the birds lived the first night through,
		And so at last to learn to use their wings.</p>
